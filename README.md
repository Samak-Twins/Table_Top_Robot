# Table_Top_Robot
The Table-Top Robot uses 4 IR sensors to detect the surface beneath it. It then processes the data in an AVR based microcontroller (ATmega16) which also controls the motors through L293D motor driver circuit. The result is that the robot turns back once it reaches the edge of the table, thus avoiding any downfall.
